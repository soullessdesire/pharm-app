# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
# Load required modules
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

# Global ServerName (optional, mainly for local development)
ServerName localhost

# VirtualHost for the first application
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@pharm_app.local
    DocumentRoot "C:/Apache24/htdocs/pharm_app"
    ServerName pharm_app.local

    <Directory "C:/Apache24/htdocs/pharm_app">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog "logs/pharm_app-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/pharm_app-access.log" common
</VirtualHost>

# VirtualHost for the second application
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@app2.local
    DocumentRoot "C:/Apache24/htdocs/app2"
    ServerName app2.local

    <Directory "C:/Apache24/htdocs/app2">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog "logs/app2-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/app2-access.log" common
</VirtualHost>
